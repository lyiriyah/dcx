# dcx
dc clone written in python. 
Supports some things dc doesn't, like logarithms, quick way to get e and pi, and a nice prompt, but doesn't support a lot dc does, like macros.

Install for Linux by running `sudo make install`. This copies it into `/usr/local/bin`, so make sure that is in your PATH.
macOS is probably the same.
For Windows IDK.
